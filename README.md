BattleShip
=======

[Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/) week two challenge. 

We were tasked with creating a model for a battleship game using TDD.

####Testing

The model is tested using [RSpec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec). Once the
repository is cloned, run `bundle` to install the dependencies and `rspec` to
run the test suite.
